# SHOP SAVY BOT

Our core idea is to build a an AI shopping platform, which has whats-up like chat interface!

1. It can listen users queries and respond with appropriate product.
2. It can read users text based queries  and respond with appropriate product.
3. It can process an input video and analyze user query related to the given video then respond with suitable similar products in which user is specifically intrested.
